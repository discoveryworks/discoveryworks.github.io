# Discovery Works

ðŸŒ¸ Why use Discovery Works?
=============================
We built this site to showcase our software labs and share our exploration of how humans and computers work together. It's a place to discover the tools and experiments we create.

ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ Who benefits from this?
=============================
- Developers looking for interesting tools and utilities
- People interested in human-computer interaction
- Anyone curious about experimental software projects

ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ What does it do?
=============================
Discovery Works is a Jekyll-based website that showcases our software projects across three distinct labs:
- **Vibe Coding Labs** - Development tools and utilities that enhance the coding experience
- **Pizza Labs** - Fun experimental projects where we explore playful interactions and game mechanics
- **NeuroSpicy Labs** - Accessibility and productivity tools designed with neurodivergent users in mind

The site uses Jekyll Collections to manage projects as individual markdown files, making it easy to add or update projects without touching HTML.
