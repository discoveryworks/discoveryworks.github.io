# Pizza Labs Brand Voice & Copywriting Guidelines

**Purpose:** Single reference document for Pizza Labs brand voice, tone, and copywriting principles.

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

---

## Core Philosophy

Pizza Labs is NOT a mobile game company. It's an absurdist art project that happens to monetize through app stores.

**Three Core Principles:**
1. **"Have fun. Don't overthink it."** ™
2. **"Minimal modification, maximum joy."**
3. **"Pizza makes everything better."**

---

## Brand Positioning

**What We Are:**
- Absurdist art collective making retro arcade games with pizza emojis
- Constraint-based creativity lab (every game MUST feature pizza)
- Learning-in-public indie development story
- The Liquid Death / MSCHF of mobile games

**What We're NOT:**
- Traditional game studio
- Serious indie game company
- Marketing gimmick
- Ironic detachment without craft

**Competitive Moat:** Nobody else is stupid enough to do this consistently—and that's the point.

---

## The Academic vs. Sincere Duality

Pizza Labs speaks in **two voices simultaneously**. Think of it as the "4 Moods" manifesto approach—we can be both at once.

### Voice 1: Academic / Pretentious (Used Sparingly)

**When:** Manifesto, press materials, ironic framing
**Tone:** Overly formal, philosophical, self-aware parody of art criticism

**Example:**
> "Pizza Labs operates at the intersection of ludological tradition and contemporary symbolic systems, interrogating the semiotics of familiar game mechanics through pizza-based intervention..."

**Why:** Creates contrast, signals self-awareness, gives press a hook

### Voice 2: Sincere / Casual (Primary Voice)

**When:** Game descriptions, social media, dev logs, most copy
**Tone:** Direct, playful, honest, slightly absurd but genuine

**Example:**
> "We put pizza in old games and it's funny. That's it. That's the whole thing."

**Why:** Accessible, authentic, builds trust with players

### Using Both Together

The **juxtaposition** is the brand. Show both voices side-by-side to create humor and self-awareness.

**Example (from website concept):**
```
Left column:  "...interrogating the semiotics of familiar game mechanics..."
Right column: "We made Pong with a pizza paddle."
```

## Copywriting Principles

### DO ✅

- **Be direct** - Say what the thing is in plain language
  - ✅ "Asteroids. (But with more pizza.)"
  - ❌ "Experience retro-inspired space adventure gameplay"

- **Embrace the absurdity** - Don't justify or explain away the premise
  - ✅ "Every game must feature pizza. That's the only rule."
  - ❌ "We chose pizza as a creative constraint because..."

- **Use self-aware humor** - Acknowledge when something is ridiculous
  - ✅ "This is the stupidest thing we've ever made and we love it."
  - ❌ "Revolutionary gaming experience"

- **Be transparent** - Share real numbers, failures, learnings
  - ✅ "Made $3.47 in ad revenue this week. Here's the breakdown."
  - ❌ "Optimizing monetization strategies"

- **Respect the source material** - Show genuine appreciation for the classics
  - ✅ "Asteroids is perfect. We just added pizza."
  - ❌ "We fixed Asteroids by making it about pizza"

- **Write like a human** - Conversational, not corporate
  - ✅ "We're trying to figure out if this can make money."
  - ❌ "Exploring sustainable revenue models for portfolio brands"

### DON'T ❌

- **Don't over-explain the joke**
  - ❌ "We thought it would be funny if we took classic games and replaced the graphics with pizza emojis because pizza is universally loved and..."
  - ✅ "What if Pong, but pizza?"

- **Don't apologize or hedge**
  - ❌ "We know this might seem silly, but..."
  - ✅ "This is silly. That's why it works."

- **Don't use marketing buzzwords**
  - ❌ "Innovative gaming solutions", "next-gen gameplay", "immersive experience"
  - ✅ "We put pizza in Pong. It works."

- **Don't be mean-spirited** - Absurd ≠ cynical
  - ❌ "Other games suck, ours are better because pizza"
  - ✅ "We love these games. We're just making them slightly weirder."

- **Don't fake authenticity**
  - ❌ "As a lifelong gamer..." (if not true)
  - ✅ "I made this in 3 weeks to learn Swift. A friend's kids won't stop playing it."

- **Don't oversell**
  - ❌ "The most addictive mobile game of 2025!"
  - ✅ "It's Asteroids with a pizza. You'll probably like it."

## Game Description Formula

**Structure:** `[Classic Game]. (But with more pizza.)`

**Examples:**
- Pizzaroids: "Asteroids. (But with more pizza.)"
- Pizza Pong: "Pong. (But with more pizza.)"
- Tic Tac Pizza: "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. (But with more pizza.)"
- Pizza Ping: "Network latency monitor. (But with more pizza.)"

**Why this works:**
1. Immediately clear what the game is
2. Sets expectations (it's a remix, not original)
3. The "(But...)" adds playful tone
4. Consistent across portfolio

**Variation allowed:** For longer descriptions, add one line of context:
> "Asteroids. (But with more pizza.)
> Dodge cosmic pepperoni. Collect power-ups. Try not to overthink it."

---

## Press & Media Voice

### Email Pitches

**Tone:** Casual, self-aware, gets to the point fast

**Template Structure:**
1. **Hook:** One-sentence absurdist premise
2. **Origin story:** Why this exists (should be interesting/relatable)
3. **Proof of concept:** Real numbers, traction, or human interest angle
4. **The experiment:** What we're testing/learning
5. **CTA:** Press kit link + availability

**Example opening:**
> "I accidentally created an absurdist art project called Pizza Labs. It started as a dumb experiment: 'Can I build iOS apps with AI assistance?' To remove product risk, I made Pong with a pizza as the paddle. It worked."

### Press Kit Language

**Tagline options:**
- "Pizza makes everything better."
- "Absurdist arcade games where you play as pizza."
- "Testing if constraint-based art projects can compete with mobile games."

**About blurb:**
> "Pizza Labs began with the stupidest possible question: 'What if Pong, but pizza?' This ridiculous premise became our north star. We take games you know by heart and add just enough pizza to make you smile."

**Founder quote (for press):**
> "I'm trying to figure out if absurdist portfolio brands can make money. Every game teaches me something new about iOS development, monetization, or multiplatform distribution. The pizza constraint keeps it fun."

---

## Social Media Voice

### Twitter/X
- **Short, punchy, visual**
- Lead with gameplay GIFs
- Self-deprecating but confident
- Engage with indie dev community authentically

**Examples:**
- "Made Asteroids where you're a pizza slice. My friends' kids won't stop playing it. Not sure how to feel about this."
- "Week 1 ad revenue: $3.47. Week 2 ad revenue: $8.13. We're basically printing money at this point. 🍕"
- "The hardest part of Pizza Labs isn't the coding. It's explaining to people that yes, this is a real thing I'm spending time on."

### Reddit
- **Transparent, developer-focused, community-oriented**
- Share technical learnings, not just promotion
- Respond to EVERY comment
- Admit failures and ask for advice

**Example post title:**
> "I'm building 'Pizza Labs' – absurdist remakes of classic games where everything is pizza. Trying to figure out if weird portfolio brands can make money. Here's what I've learned so far..."

---

## Dev Log / Blog Voice

### Learning-in-Public Posts

**Structure:**
1. What I built/tried
2. Why I built/tried it
3. What actually happened (with real numbers)
4. What I learned
5. What's next

**Tone:** Technical but accessible, honest about failures, curious about outcomes

**Example topics:**
- "What I learned shipping Pizzaroids v2.0 (with ads)"
- "Game Center integration took 6 hours. Here's what I learned."
- "I spent $25 on Reddit ads. Here's what happened."
- "Monetization results: Week 1 of Pizzaroids ads"

**Key principle:** Transparency = content. Share numbers even when small/embarrassing.

---

## Visual Voice (Supporting the Copy)

### Pizza Emoji Usage
- **Always use 🍕 emoji in titles and headers**
- Signals absurdity without words
- Creates visual consistency across portfolio

### Typography Personality
- **Bold, confident headings** (signals: we take craft seriously)
- **Generous spacing** (signals: we respect your time)
- **Monospace for stats** (signals: transparency, real data)

### Color Personality
- **Dark backgrounds** (modern, arcade aesthetic)
- **Neon accents** (playful, retro)
- **Clean, minimal** (we're not hiding behind clutter)

---

## What Makes Pizza Labs Voice Different

**Similar to (inspiration):**
- **Liquid Death:** Absurdist product, serious craft, humor as moat
- **MSCHF:** Drops culture, self-aware art projects, polarizing
- **Indie Hackers:** Learning-in-public, transparent numbers
- **Nutter Butter TikTok:** Low-effort high-weirdness, consistent absurdity

**Different from:**
- **Traditional game studios:** Not selling features or graphics
- **Ironic meme brands:** We actually care about the craft
- **Wholesome indie:** We're weirder, less earnest
- **Cynical satire:** Not punching down, genuinely playful

---

## Guardrails: When to Break Character

### NEVER compromise on:
1. **Transparency** - Don't hide failures or inflate numbers
2. **Craft** - Don't excuse bad work with "it's absurdist"
3. **Respect for classics** - Don't shit on the games we're remixing
4. **User time** - Don't waste people's attention with nonsense

### OK to drop absurdist voice:
- **Support emails** (be helpful, clear, professional)
- **Technical documentation** (READMEs, API docs - clarity first)
- **Legal/privacy** (just be normal and compliant)
- **Serious bugs** (acknowledge, apologize, fix)
