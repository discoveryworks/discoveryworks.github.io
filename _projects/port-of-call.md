<!-- START AUTO-GENERATED WHY (2025-07-28 19:05:42) -->
Do you have multiple Rails apps running on your machine? Tired of conflicts on port 3000? I was, so I vibe-coded this gem.

Port of Call automatically assigns deterministic port numbers to each Rails application based on its name.
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED WHY -->

Port of Call is a Ruby gem that assigns each Rails application a consistent, deterministic port number based on the application's name or repository. This solves the common conflict of multiple Rails apps all defaulting to port 3000.
