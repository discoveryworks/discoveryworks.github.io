<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED WHY -->

Deterministic non-standard port number assignment for when you're developing too many apps at once.

Port of Call is a Ruby gem that assigns each Rails application a consistent, deterministic port number based on the application's name or repository. This solves the common conflict of multiple Rails apps all defaulting to port 3000.
