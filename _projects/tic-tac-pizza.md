Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. (But with more pizza.)

Somebody dared me to make it. So here it is.

## How to Play

Win three mini-boards in a row to claim the pizza parlor. Standard Ultimate Tic Tac Toe rules: where you play determines where your opponent must play next.

🍕 Pepperoni vs 🍄 Mushroom. Choose your topping. Choose wisely.

## Features

- Local two-player pass-and-play
- Diagonal winning lines that actually line up
- Stalemate detection with appropriate shrugging (🤷)
- High score tracking by move count
- Neon arcade aesthetic

Built with React Native/Expo. Free on the App Store.
