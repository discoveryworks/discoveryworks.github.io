Turn today's gCal appointments into a markdown table, in pomodoro-sized chunks.

<!-- START AUTO-GENERATED WHY (2025-07-28 19:05:42) -->
My calendar is a canonical source of truth for commitments of my time. But I live and breathe markdown. I wanted to sit down in the morning, type a few chars into my terminal, and get my day started. That's `gday`.
