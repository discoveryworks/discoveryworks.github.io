Turn today's gCal appointments into a markdown table, in pomodoro-sized chunks.

Turn today's gCal appointments into a markdown table, in pomodoro-sized chunks.

<!-- START AUTO-GENERATED WHY (2025-07-28 19:05:42) -->
My calendar is a canonical source of truth for commitments of my time. But I live and breathe markdown. I wanted to sit down in the morning, type a few chars into my terminal, and get my day started. That's `gday`.

ðŸŒžðŸŒž Who's it for?
=============================

Me!

But maybe you too if you're brain is similarly shaped: terminal-first developers, productivity enthusiasts, and anyone who manages multiple Google Calendars while preferring command-line interfaces over GUI applications. Perfect for those who live and breathe markdown.


ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž What does it do?
=============================

It turns today's gCal appointments into a markdown table, in pomodoro-sized chunks.

- _Extract_ the day's schedule from Google Calendar,
- _Transform_ it into a markdown table, in pomodoro-sized chunks,
- _Load_ it into my daily journal (along w/ a few custom prompts)


| Go from this (Google Calendar)...                    | ...to this (gday output)                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž How do I use it?
=============================

- set it up (below)
- Each morning, type `gday` when you sit down at yr desk
- paste into yr Obsidian or Roam or whatever daily journal you use
- manually munge the rough patches and familiarize yrself with your day.
