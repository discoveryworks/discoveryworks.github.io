PhenoTheme is a VS Code extension that deterministically generates beautiful, visually optimized, disambiguated color schemes for each repository you work with. Like biological phenotypes expressing genetic information, each repository gets a unique "visual phenotype" derived from its "genetic code" (the repository name).
