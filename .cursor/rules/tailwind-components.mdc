# Tailwind CSS and Component Guidelines

## General Principles
- Follow a mobile-first approach in all UI development
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography using Tailwind's scale
- Use semantic color names in custom variables (not arbitrary hex values)
- Extract common patterns into reusable components
- Avoid inline styles - use Tailwind classes exclusively

## Component Organization
- Create custom Tailwind components for repeated UI patterns
- Follow DaisyUI-inspired component design for consistency
- Use view partials for complex reusable UI sections
- Store shared UI components in `app/views/components/` directory
- Document component usage with comments for team reference

## Responsive Design
- Start with mobile layouts and progressively enhance for larger screens
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes consistently (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Test interfaces at all breakpoints regularly
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
- Maintain touch-friendly sizing (minimum 44px height/width for interactive elements)

## Component Styling Patterns
- Buttons: Use consistent classes for primary/secondary/tertiary actions
- Forms: Maintain uniform input styling and error states
- Cards: Consistent padding, shadows, and rounded corners
- Navigation: Clear visual hierarchy and active states
- Lists: Uniform spacing and dividers

## Dark Mode (Future)
- Use Tailwind's dark mode variant when implementing dark mode
- Test color contrast in both light and dark themes
- Avoid hard-coded colors that don't respect theme preferences
